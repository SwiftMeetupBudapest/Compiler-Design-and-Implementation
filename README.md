Compiler Design and Implementation
--------

This repository contains the code accompanying the practice-oriented
parts of the "Compiler Design and Implementation" series of lectures
performed during the 2015/16 season of Budapest Swift Meetup.

The code usually closely resembles what has been written during
the live coding sessions. Bug fixes, other improvements and
modifications may be committed without notice, though.

The code is placed into the public domain; there is no warranty
whatsoever.
